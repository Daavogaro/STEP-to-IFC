# STEP-to-IFC Blender Add-on

This addon for Blender was developed as part of a project to convert STEP files to the IFC-SPF (Step Physical File) format. The repository includes a complete guide to the procedure used, with all references used in the process.
Although the main focus is STEP to IFC conversion, the addon is compatible with any format that can be imported into Blender.

### How to install the add-on

1. **Install Blender** </br>

### How to use STEP-to-IFC add-on

As mentioned in the introduction, this add-on was developed as part of a project focused on converting STEP files to the IFC-SPF format. However, the add-on is **not limited to STEP** files but it works with **any file format that Blender can import**.

If you're starting with a STEP file, the next section will guide you through the recommended workflow. Otherwise, feel free to skip ahead.

> ### How to convert STEP in glTF
>
> Blender doesn't support importing STEP files directly, so an intermediate format is needed. Among the available open-source options, `glTF` is the most suitable and widely supported format for this purpose.
>
> 1. **Download Mayo** </br>
>    Mayo is an open source software that can read/write 3D files from/to `STEP, IGES, STL and many other CAD formats`
>    Release packages are available for Windows and Linux. Follow the instructions here to set it up: [Mayo Github Page](https://github.com/fougue/mayo/tree/develop)
> 2. **Import STEP file** </br>
> 3. **Export glTF file** </br>
