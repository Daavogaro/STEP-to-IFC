# STEP-to-IFC Blender Add-on

This addon for Blender was developed as part of a project to convert STEP files to the IFC-SPF (Step Physical File) format. The repository includes a complete guide to the procedure used, with all references used in the process.
Although the main focus is STEP to IFC conversion, the addon is compatible with any format that can be imported into Blender.
